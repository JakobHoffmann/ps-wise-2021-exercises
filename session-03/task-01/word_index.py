# The Things Style Description:
#
# - The larger problem is decomposed into 'things' that make sense for
#   the problem domain
#
# - Each 'thing' is a capsule of data that exposes procedures to the
#   rest of the world
#
# - Data is never accessed directly, only through these procedures
#
# - Capsules can "reappropriate" procedures defined in other capsules

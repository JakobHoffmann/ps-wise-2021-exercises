# The Infinite Mirror Style Description:
#
# - All, or a significant part, of the problem is modelled by
#   induction. That is, specify the base case (n_0) and then the n+1
#   rule
#
#

# NOTE: there's no need for implementing everything as a functions here
# since any abstraction would be fine. However, in as many point as possible we
# need to use recursion

# Defining a main method makes testing easier

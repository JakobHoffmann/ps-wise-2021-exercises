# Exercise 07

Implement the Word Index program using the functional Programming Styles.

The description of Word Index is the usual one:

Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and outputs all the words contained in it sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur. The program assumes that a page is a sequence of 45 lines. 
Each line has max 80 characters, and words cannot be split. Assume that no word is longer than 80 characters.

## Task 1: Infinite Mirror Style

To complete this task you must: Implement the Word Index program using the **Infinite Mirror Style** 

## Task 2: The Kick Forward Style

To complete this task you must: Implement the Word Index program using the **Kick Forward Style** 

> Note that the Kick Forward style is a variation of the Pipeline style. Both styles use the same (functional) decomposition of the large program.

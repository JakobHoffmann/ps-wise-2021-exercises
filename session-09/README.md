# Exercise 09

Implement the Word Index program using the concurrency related Programming Styles.

The description of Word Index is the usual one:

Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and outputs all the words contained in it sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur. The program assumes that a page is a sequence of 45 lines. 
Each line has max 80 characters, and words cannot be split. Assume that no word is longer than 80 characters.


## Task 1: Actors Style

To complete this task you must: Implement the Word Index program using the **Actors Style** 

> Note: the Actors style is a variation of the Letterbox style, hence both styles use the same decomposition of the large program into things.


## Task 2: Dataspaces Style

To complete this task you must: Implement the Word Index program using the **Dataspaces Style**
